The Mast is a new Rain World region, in the form of a large transmission spire in the western area of the world. Now returning with a coat of new paint and a bunch of new content for Downpour!

## This mod includes...
- A new region that connects to Sky Islands, Subterranean and the modded region Badlands
- Over 400 new screens, spanning a diverse and detailed environment
- A full original soundtrack
- Unique creature spawns and world changes for all vanilla and MSC slugcats
- A number of custom gameplay features to discover, including a new critter!
- Spearmaster has access to an alternate ending location
- Significant world changes for Saint
- 3 custom arenas

## Recommended playthroughs
- For a first playthrough, I recommend one of the three vanilla slugcats, but all slugcats have had their world state tuned to be unique and balanced.
- For those familiar with the mod, or returning players for Downpour, I recommend exploring the region as late-game Spearmaster, and/or early-game Saint.
