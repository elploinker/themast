Looks to the Moon.
Enclosed within this broadcast are a series of access strains and an override permit to the Clastic Basin shared aquifer pump system.
It contains every signage from the oversight councils, and is capable of a full shutdown of Five Pebbles' intakes.

I can only hope that the embedded guiding probes bypass his blockades without him noticing, and this package crawls its way to you.
Sincerely, a friend.
