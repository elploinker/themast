      Attach the following files.
      These can be found in your Rain World installation folder (found by right-clicking the game on Steam and going to `Manage -> Browse Local Files`).
      - `exceptionLog.txt`
      - `consoleLog.txt`
      - `BepInEx\logOutput.log`
      - `RainWorld_Data\StreamingAssets\crsLog.txt`

      *Note that restarting the game clears these logs, so if you experience the bug, copy the contents before you reopen the game after closing it!*
